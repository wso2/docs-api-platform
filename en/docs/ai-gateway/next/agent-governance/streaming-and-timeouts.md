# Streaming and timeouts

Two Agent2Agent (A2A) operations return a stream of events rather than a single response, and they stay open as long as the agent has something to say. A timeout tuned for a request-response API cuts those streams off mid-task, so the gateway treats them differently by default.

## The streaming operations

| Operation | HTTP+JSON | What it streams |
|---|---|---|
| `SendStreamingMessage` | `POST /message:stream` | Events for the task the message started |
| `SubscribeToTask` | `POST /tasks/{id}:subscribe` | Events for a task already running |

Both return Server-Sent Events (SSE). The gateway forwards the stream as the agent produces it and doesn't buffer, reorder, or reframe events. Streaming semantics belong to the agent.

A client discovers whether an agent streams at all from `capabilities.streaming` in its Agent Card. See [Agent Card](agent-card.md).

## Timeout defaults

A route timeout caps the time from request to upstream response. For a stream, that ceiling is the length of the whole stream, which is why the gateway disables it by default on the routes that carry one:

| Route | Default route timeout |
|---|---|
| The JSON-RPC endpoint | Disabled |
| HTTP+JSON streaming operations | Disabled |
| Every other HTTP+JSON operation | The gateway's global route timeout |

The JSON-RPC endpoint is disabled because it's one route. Every operation arrives at the same path, with the operation named in the body, so a route-level timeout there would apply to streaming and non-streaming calls alike.

This differs from REST APIs and LLM proxies, which fall back to the global route timeout on every route.

!!! note "The idle timeout is the liveness guard"
    Disabling the route timeout doesn't leave a dead connection open. The stream idle timeout still applies, and it's the right control for a stream: it measures the gap between events rather than the total duration, so it closes a stream that has stopped producing without cutting off one that's still working.

## Set timeouts on an agent

Set `resilience` at the agent level to apply a limit to every traffic-forwarding route:

```yaml
spec:
  displayName: Trip Planner
  version: v1.0
  context: /trip-planner
  upstream:
    url: http://host.docker.internal:9099
  resilience:
    timeout: 60s
    idleTimeout: 5m
```

Both values take a duration such as `500ms`, `30s`, `5m`, or `1h`. Setting either to `0s` disables it.

Set `timeout` here only when you want a hard ceiling on how long any single call may run, streams included. It overrides the disabled default, so a stream that outlives it is cut off.

## Set timeouts on one operation

Per-operation `resilience` sits beside `policies` in the same `operations` entry, and takes precedence over the agent-level value for that operation's route:

```yaml
  a2a:
    operationConfigs:
      operations:
        - name: SendMessage
          resilience:
            timeout: 30s
        - name: SendStreamingMessage
          resilience:
            idleTimeout: 2m
```

This is the combination most agents want: a firm ceiling on the request-response operations, and an idle timeout on the streaming ones so a stalled stream closes while a long, productive one doesn't.

Per-operation timeouts apply to HTTP+JSON routes, which is where each operation has a route of its own. On the JSON-RPC endpoint, every operation shares one route and therefore one timeout.

## Test a streaming operation

Request a stream and watch events arrive:

```bash
curl -N -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/trip-planner/v1/message:stream \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'A2A-Version: 1.0' \
  -d '{"message":{"messageId":"m1","role":"ROLE_USER",
       "parts":[{"text":"Plan a 3 day trip to Ella slowly"}]}}'
```

`-N` disables `curl`'s output buffering, so events print as they arrive rather than at the end.
