# Authenticate agent clients

An agent deployed without an authentication policy answers every caller that can reach it. This page shows you how to require a credential on an Agent2Agent (A2A) agent's operations, issue an API key for it, and call the agent with that key.

This page is for the **platform administrator** who protects the agent and issues keys, and the **AI developer** whose client sends them.

## Where authentication applies

Attaching an authentication policy does two things at once:

- **It protects the agent's operations.** Requests without a valid credential are rejected before they reach the agent.
- **It makes the protected Agent Card reachable.** The gateway requires an authenticated request before it returns the extended card, and answers `401` otherwise. An agent with no authentication policy therefore never publishes its extended card. See [Agent Card](agent-card.md).

Public Agent Card serving is separate, and deliberately stays open. A client reads the card to discover the agent before it holds any credential, so protecting the card stops discovery.

## Require an API key

Attach the `api-key-auth` policy to the agent's common operation policies:

```yaml
  a2a:
    protocolVersion: "1.0"
    operationConfigs:
      transports:
        - protocolBinding: JSONRPC
          pathPrefix: /
        - protocolBinding: HTTP+JSON
          pathPrefix: /v1
      policies:
        - name: api-key-auth
          version: v1
          params:
            key: X-API-Key
            in: header
```

`params.key` names the header the gateway reads the key from, and `params.in` sets where to look. Header matching is case-insensitive, and the policy's default header name is `API-Key`.

Because this policy sits in the common scope, it covers every operation on both bindings. To require more of one operation — a scope on `CancelTask`, for instance — add a per-operation entry as well. See [Apply policies](apply-policies.md).

## Create a key for the agent

Create a key for the client that calls the agent. This command keeps the value in a shell variable rather than printing it to your terminal or shell history:

```bash
AGENT_CONSUMER_KEY=$(curl -s -X POST \
  http://localhost:9090/api/management/v1/agents/trip-planner-v1.0/api-keys \
  -u "$ADMIN_USERNAME:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"trip-planner-client"}' \
  | jq -r '.apiKey.apiKey')
```

Replace *`trip-planner-v1.0`* with your agent's name and *`trip-planner-client`* with a name for the key. The `name` field is optional; without it the gateway generates an identifier.

Check that a key came back:

```bash
test -n "$AGENT_CONSUMER_KEY" && test "$AGENT_CONSUMER_KEY" != "null"
```

Keys are a 32-byte random value in hexadecimal, prefixed with `apip_`. Two things about the response matter:

- **The value is returned only when the key is created or regenerated.** Store it securely. If you lose it, regenerate the key rather than trying to read it back.
- **The response reports `remainingApiKeyQuota`,** so you can see how many more keys you can create.

## Call the agent with the key

Send the key in the header the policy names, alongside the mandatory protocol version:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/trip-planner/v1/message:send \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'A2A-Version: 1.0' \
  -H "X-API-Key: ${AGENT_CONSUMER_KEY}" \
  -d '{"message":{"messageId":"m1","role":"ROLE_USER",
       "parts":[{"text":"Plan a 2 day trip to Galle"}]}}'
```

A request to a protected operation without a valid key returns `401`.

The public Agent Card needs no key, which is how a client finds the agent in the first place:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/trip-planner/.well-known/agent-card.json
```

## Require a JWT instead

To validate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) against an identity provider, attach `jwt-auth` in the same place:

```yaml
      policies:
        - name: jwt-auth
          version: v1
          params:
            issuers:
              - PrimaryIdp
```

Add `scopes` to a per-operation entry to require more of a particular operation:

```yaml
      operations:
        - name: CancelTask
          policies:
            - name: jwt-auth
              version: v1
              params:
                issuers:
                  - PrimaryIdp
                scopes:
                  allOf:
                    - "trip:cancel"
```

Where authentication sits among an agent's policies is your decision. The gateway's protected-card check only asks whether some policy in the chain authenticated the request.

## Manage keys

The management API exposes five operations for the key lifecycle, all requiring Basic Auth and the `admin` or `consumer` role. Replace *`{id}`* with the agent's name and *`{apiKeyName}`* with the key's name.

| Operation | Request | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Create | `POST /agents/{id}/api-keys` | Generates a key for the agent and returns its value. |
| List | `GET /agents/{id}/api-keys` | Lists the agent's keys. Values aren't included. |
| Regenerate | `POST /agents/{id}/api-keys/{apiKeyName}/regenerate` | Issues a new value and returns it. The previous value stops working. |
| Update | `PUT /agents/{id}/api-keys/{apiKeyName}` | Sets a custom value on a key, for injecting an externally issued one. |
| Revoke | `DELETE /agents/{id}/api-keys/{apiKeyName}` | Revokes a key, so it can no longer authenticate requests. |

Regenerate a key when you rotate credentials, and revoke one as soon as you believe it's exposed. Use a separate key for each client and each environment, so revoking one doesn't interrupt the others.

For the full request and response reference, see [Agent management](../reference/management-api/agent-management.md).
